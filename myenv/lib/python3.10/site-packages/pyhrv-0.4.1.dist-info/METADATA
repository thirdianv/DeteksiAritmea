pyHRV is an open-source Python toolbox that computes state-of-the-art Heart Rate Variability (HRV) parameters from Electrocardiography (ECG), SpO2, Blood Volume Pulse (BVP), or other signals with heart rate indicators.

With pyHRV, we aim to provide a user-friendly and versatile Python toolbox for HRV dedicated education, research, and application development.

It provides provides comprehensible source code to help beginners understand the fundamentals of HRV parameter computation, while providing the most important HRV analysis functionalities for developers and publication-quality plots of the results for researchers.
# Getting Started

### Installation & Python Compatibility
This toolbox can be installed using the ```pip``` tool.

```python
pip install pyhrv
```
Dependencies: [biosppy](https://github.com/PIA-Group/BioSPPy) | [numpy](http://www.numpy.org) | [scipy](http://scipy.org) | [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) | [nolds](https://github.com/CSchoel/nolds) | [spectrum](https://github.com/cokelaer/spectrum)

# pyHRV Core Features & HRV Parameter List

With pyHRV, you can compute up to 78 HRV parameters while using other useful non-parameter-specific tools to support 
your HRV research.

### Time Domain Parameters

- Basic statistical parameters of a NNI series - ```pyhrv.time_domain.nni_parameters()``` 
- Basic statistical parameters of a ΔNNI series - ```pyhrv.time_domain.nni_differences_parameters()```
- Basic statistical parameters of a Heart Rate (HR) series - ```pyhrv.time_domain.hr_parameters()``` 
- Standard deviation of a NNI series (SDNN) - ```pyhrv.time_domain.sdnn()``` 
- Mean of the SDNN of 5 successive 5 minute segments extracted from long-term NNI series (SDNN<sub>index</sub>)- ```pyhrv.time_domain.sdnn_index()``` 
- Standard deviation of the mean of 5 minute segments extracted from long-term NNI series (SDANN) - ```pyhrv.time_domain.sdann()``` 
- Root mean square of successive difference (RMSSD) - ```pyhrv.time_domain.rmssd()``` 
- Standard deviation of successive differences (SDSD) - ```pyhrv.time_domain.sdsd()``` 
- NNx & pNNx parameters - ```pyhrv.time_domain.nnXX()``` 
- NN20 & pNN20 parameters - ```pyhrv.time_domain.nn20()``` 
- NN50 & pNN50 parameters - ```pyhrv.time_domain.nn50()``` 
- Triangular Index (Maximum of the Histogram / Width of the Histogram) - ```pyhrv.time_domain.triangular_index()``` 
- Triangular Interpolation Function (TINN)<sup>1</sup> - ```pyhrv.time_domain.tinn()```

<sup><sup>1</sup> the current version of pyHRV has some bug which causes misleading and false results for the TINN 
function. [An issue has already been opened for this purpose...](https://github.com/PGomes92/pyhrv/issues/5)

### Frequency Domain Parameters
Computes the following Frequency Domain parameters from the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of a NNI series computed 
using the following PSD methods:

- Welch's Method - ```pyhrv.frequency_domain.welch_psd()```
- Autoregressive - ```pyhrv.frequency_domain.ar_psd()```
- Lomb-Scargle - ```pyhrv.frequency_domain.lomb_psd()```

Frequency parameters:
- Peak Frequencies
- Absolute Powers
- Logarithmic Powers
- Relative Powers
- Normalized Powers (LF and HF only)
- LF/HF ratio

The parameters are computed for the Very Low Frequency (VLF), Low Frequency (LF), and High Frequency (HF) bands. The 
Frequency Bands can be customized, including an Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) band.

Sample plots of the resulting PSD plots and Frequency Domain parameters using pyHRV can be seen below:

#### PSD Comparison Features - 2D Comparison Plot
Plot PSDs from multiple NNI segments extracted from a NNI series (e.g. 5 minute segments of a 60 minute recording) in a 3D Waterfall Plot using the Welch, Autoregressive or Lomb-Scargle method and compute the Frequency Domain parameters from each segment - ```pyhrv.frequency_domain.psd_comparison()``` [[source](https://github.com/PGomes92/pyhrv/blob/b5c5baaa8bf1ad085dc2dfe46b477171fe153682/pyhrv/frequency_domain.py#L970)].
